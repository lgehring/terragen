The maximum possible height is 1024m (255), the minimum is 0m (0).
This results in a resolution of ~4m per brightness-step.

When creating custom heightmaps, use a square image with a resolution of minimum 800x800 pixels.
The image must always depict 8km^2 of terrain. The height range is 0-1024m.
(Only the inner 2km^2 of the image are used for the heightmap at the moment)
